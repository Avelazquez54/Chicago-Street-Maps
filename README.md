# Hello there. Hope you are doing well!

# This is an command-line based application that uses latitude and longitude coordinates of locations within the University of Illinois
# to provide a location for 2 people to meet on campus that is between them.

# This project utilizes maps data structure for better runtime performance as well as data load management thanks to the built-in functions for Maps.
# Project is based on CS 251 coursework thus this project is private for this reason.
